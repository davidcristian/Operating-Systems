# Extra

1) A special character c, a number n (n<20) and the name of the output file are read from the keyboard. Write the content of the input file in the output file, but replace the bytes from the positions that are a multiple of n with the special character c.

2) A file name, a special character s, and a number n represented on a byte are read from the keyboard. The file contains words separated by spaces. Write in the output.txt file the same words transformed as follows: the n-th character of each word is swapped with the special character. (If the number of characters of the word is less than n, the missing number of characters is to be completed with the special character s)

    Example:  
    File name: 2.txt  
    File contents: apple pear orange watermelon  
    s: +  
    n: 6  
    output.txt: apple+ pear++ orang+ water+elon
